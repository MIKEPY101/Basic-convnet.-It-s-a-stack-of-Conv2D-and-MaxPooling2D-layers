Specifically, layers extract representations out of the data fed into them—hopefully, representations that are more meaningful for the problem at hand. Most of deep learning consists of chaining together simple layers that will implement a form of progressive data distillation. A deep-learning model is like a sieve for data processing, made of a succession of increasingly refined data filters—the layers. Here, our network consists of a sequence of two Dense layers, which are densely connected (also called fully connected) neural layers. The second (and last) layer is a 10-way softmax layer, which means it will return an array of 10 probability scores (summing to 1). Each score will be the probability that the current digit image belongs to one of our 10 digit classes. \n",
