# Basic-convnet.-It-s-a-stack-of-Conv2D-and-MaxPooling2D-layers.Coursework from Deep Learning With Python, Francios Chollet
A convnet takes as input tensors of shape (image_height, image_width, image_channels) (not including the batch dimension). In this case, we’ll configure the convnet to process inputs of size (28, 28, 1), which is the format of MNIST images. We’ll do this by passing the argument input_shape=(28, 28, 1) to the first layer.
